In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to use LLMs programmatically in R, and come away with both the confidence to experiment and a working script that extracts data from unstructured text.\nWe’ll look at where LLMs can help, where they’ll let you down, and techniques for making your results more trustworthy. You’re going to leave with a practical sense of what’s possible and where to be cautious.\nWhat you’ll learn:\n\nGetting started with LLMs in R using {ellmer}\nPrompt engineering for more predictable results\nExtracting structured data from unstructured text\nUsing LLMs to call R functions (tool calling)\n\n\n\nWorkshop Prework\n\nEnvironment\nYou’ll need an R environment to work in; this could be RStudio or Positron on your own laptop, or an account on Posit Cloud via a web browser.\nIf you’re on a work machine with restrictions on installing software or connecting to external APIs, Posit Cloud is a good option as everything runs in your browser.\n\n\nPackages\nInstall the required packages:\ninstall.packages(c(\"ellmer\", \"mall\", \"dplyr\", \"readr\", \"tidyr\", \"usethis\"))\n\n\nAPI keys\nYou’ll need an API key from an LLM provider. We recommend Gemini (free), but Anthropic or OpenAI work too if you already have credits.\nOption 1: Gemini (free)\n\nGo to Google AI Studio\nSign in with your Google account\nClick “Create API key”\nCopy the key\n\nOption 2: Anthropic or OpenAI (paid)\nIf you already have an Anthropic or OpenAI account with credits, you can use that instead.\nOnce you have your key, run usethis::edit_r_environ() and save the key as:\nGOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here\n# OR\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here\n# OR\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here\nYou will need to restart your R session after saving the environment variable.\n\n\nTest setup\nAfter installing packages and setting up your API key, verify everything works:\nlibrary(ellmer)\n\n# Test API connection (restart R first if you just set the key!)\nchat &lt;- chat_google_gemini()  # or chat_anthropic() / chat_openai()\nchat$chat(\"Say hello in one sentence\")\nIf you see a response from the LLM, you’re all set!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n\nSection 0: Welcome and Setup\nSection 1: Getting Started with LLMs in R\nSection 2: Prompt Engineering\nSection 3: Structured Output\nSection 4: Tool Calling\nSection 5: Wrap-up and Resources\n\n\n\nInstructor\nNic Crane is an R consultant with a background in data science and software engineering. They are passionate about open source, and learning and teaching all things R.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Nic Crane. All Rights Reserved."
