Happiest Season,2020,"Abby and Harper have been dating for nearly a year when Harper invites Abby to spend Christmas with her family. Abby sees this as the perfect opportunity to propose—until Harper reveals during the drive that she hasn't actually come out to her conservative parents. With Harper's father running for mayor and the family obsessed with appearances, Harper asks Abby to pretend to be her straight roommate for the holiday. What follows is an increasingly uncomfortable charade as Abby navigates the Caldwell family dynamics: the competitive older sister Sloane, the overlooked younger sister Jane, and parents who expect perfection. Abby meets Harper's ex-girlfriend Riley, who warns her that Harper has a history of hiding who she really is. As Harper repeatedly chooses her family's approval over Abby's feelings, their relationship strains to breaking point. When secrets finally explode at the family's Christmas Eve party, both sisters are forced to confront truths they've been hiding. The film is a holiday romantic comedy that tackles the real anxieties of coming out to family, balancing humor with genuine emotional stakes. It was the first lesbian Christmas rom-com produced by a major Hollywood studio."
Tár,2022,"Lydia Tár is one of the most celebrated conductors in the world—the first female chief conductor of a major German orchestra, an EGOT winner, a protégé of Leonard Bernstein. The film opens at the height of her power as she promotes her memoir and prepares a landmark recording of Mahler's Fifth Symphony. But cracks begin to show. Lydia is manipulative and controlling, favoring young women she finds attractive, including a new Russian cellist she maneuvers into the orchestra. Her assistant Francesca, once close to her, grows resentful. When a former mentee named Krista, whom Lydia blacklisted after their falling out, dies by suicide, Lydia instructs Francesca to delete incriminating emails. A viral video distorts her comments at a masterclass, and accusations of predatory behavior surface. Her carefully constructed world collapses: her wife discovers her lies, Francesca turns against her, and she is removed from her position. The film refuses easy judgments—Lydia is genuinely brilliant and her downfall involves both legitimate grievances and mob dynamics. In a devastating final act, the once-mighty maestro finds herself conducting a video game concert in Southeast Asia, her fall from grace complete. The film is a complex examination of power, art, cancel culture, and whether genius excuses abuse."
All of Us Strangers,2023,"Adam is a lonely screenwriter living in an almost-empty London tower block, working on a script about his childhood. One night, his neighbor Harry—younger, drunk, charming—knocks on his door wanting company. Adam sends him away, but later seeks him out, and they begin a tentative romance. Meanwhile, Adam visits his childhood home in the suburbs and encounters his parents, who appear exactly as they did when they died in a car accident when he was twelve. These visitations become regular: he has dinner with them, walks through his old neighborhood, has the conversations about his life they never got to have. He comes out to his mother, who accepts him with only slight discomfort. He confronts his father about failing to protect him from childhood bullying. As Adam's relationship with Harry deepens, so does the mystery of what is actually happening. Are these ghosts? Hallucinations? Something else? The film moves toward a shattering revelation about Harry that recontextualizes everything. Director Andrew Haigh creates a devastating meditation on grief, queerness, and the conversations we wish we could have had with those we've lost."
Bottoms,2023,"PJ and Josie are unpopular lesbian best friends at a football-obsessed high school where they pine hopelessly for popular cheerleaders Brittany and Isabel. When a misunderstanding leads to rumors that they spent summer in juvenile detention, they lean into the notoriety and start a ""self-defense club"" with an ulterior motive: to get close to their crushes. The club's ""lessons"" are chaotic beatings that somehow bond the members together. As PJ and Josie grow closer to their respective crushes, complications arise—Hazel, their unhinged friend, discovers her mother is sleeping with Isabel's quarterback boyfriend, leading to an escalating series of acts including car bombings. When their lies are exposed at a pep rally, the girls are humiliated. But redemption comes when the rival school's football team attacks during the big game, and the fight club girls must defend their classmates in an absurdly violent climax. Director Emma Seligman crafts a gleefully unhinged satire that treats its queer protagonists' horniness and scheming as completely normal while the straight world around them is insane."
Love Lies Bleeding,2024,"In 1989 New Mexico, Lou manages a gym and exists in a holding pattern—unable to leave town because of her abusive brother-in-law JJ and her powerful, criminal father Lou Sr. When Jackie walks into the gym, everything changes. Jackie is an ambitious bodybuilder heading to a Las Vegas competition, and she and Lou fall into an intense relationship. Lou supplies Jackie with steroids, and their passion grows alongside Jackie's muscles and aggression. When JJ beats Lou's sister Beth severely enough to hospitalize her, Jackie's steroid-fueled rage explodes. She kills JJ. Lou helps cover it up, framing her father for the murder. But the fallout spirals: a jealous friend blackmails Lou, Jackie's mental state deteriorates, and Lou Sr. draws Jackie into his criminal web. Director Rose Glass crafts a fever dream of lesbian noir—part romance, part body horror, part crime thriller. The film uses surreal imagery and Jackie's steroid-enhanced transformations to create something both viscerally physical and hallucinatory."
Queer,2024,"In 1950s Mexico City, William Lee is an American expatriate drifting through bars and casual encounters. A middle-aged addict unable to connect with anyone, he becomes obsessed with Eugene Allerton, a younger American who maintains an emotional distance despite their physical relationship. Allerton does not consider himself ""queer"" the way Lee does—he is ""disembodied,"" detached from his own desires. Lee convinces Allerton to travel with him to South America in search of yagé, a plant rumored to grant telepathic abilities. Their journey takes them deep into the Ecuadorian jungle, where a reclusive botanist brews ayahuasca for them. The hallucinogenic experience is transcendent and terrifying—they communicate telepathically, their bodies merge, they vomit their hearts. But the trip cannot bridge the fundamental gap between them. Allerton leaves, and Lee returns to Mexico City alone, still searching for connection he may never find. Based on William S. Burroughs' autobiographical novella, director Luca Guadagnino creates a lush, melancholy portrait of unrequited obsession and queer longing in an era of secrecy and shame."
Moonlight,2016,"Told in three chapters, the film follows Chiron, a young Black man growing up in Miami, as he grapples with his identity and sexuality across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In the first chapter, young Chiron—nicknamed ""Little""—is a withdrawn, bullied child who finds an unlikely father figure in Juan, a local drug dealer. Juan and his girlfriend Teresa provide refuge from Chiron's crack-addicted mother, though Chiron eventually learns the painful truth about Juan's role in her addiction. As a teenager, Chiron remains isolated and targeted by bullies while developing feelings for his friend Kevin—feelings that culminate in a tender encounter on a moonlit beach. But when Kevin is coerced into participating in Chiron's violent beating, the betrayal sends Chiron into a rage that leads to his arrest. The final chapter finds an adult Chiron transformed into a hardened Atlanta drug dealer. A surprise phone call from Kevin prompts a return to Miami, where the two men cautiously reconnect. In a quiet diner, Chiron admits he has never been intimate with anyone since that night on the beach. The film is a meditation on masculinity, vulnerability, and the long journey toward self-acceptance."
Call Me by Your Name,2017,"In the summer of 1983, seventeen-year-old Elio Perlman lives with his academic parents in their villa in northern Italy. When Oliver, a confident twenty-four-year-old American graduate student, arrives to assist Elio's archaeologist father, Elio initially dismisses him as brash. Yet as the lazy summer days unfold, Elio finds himself increasingly drawn to Oliver. Their relationship develops slowly through shared bike rides, trips to town, and long conversations. After weeks of tension, they finally act on their feelings, beginning an intense romance they must keep hidden. As Oliver's departure approaches, Elio's parents—who seem to understand more than they say—encourage them to spend a few days together. Their final days are bittersweet, and Oliver's departure leaves Elio devastated. In the film's most celebrated scene, Elio's father offers unexpected comfort and wisdom, telling him that such connections are rare and precious, and that he should not make himself feel nothing in order to avoid pain. The film is a sensory portrait of first love set against sun-drenched Italian landscapes."
Paris Is Burning,1990,"This documentary chronicles the ball culture of New York City in the late 1980s, a subculture created by Black and Latino gay men and transgender women who found family, fame, and self-expression in elaborate competitions. At balls, contestants ""walk"" in categories—fashion, dance, ""realness"" (the ability to pass as straight or as a particular gender or class)—competing for trophies and legendary status. The film interviews key figures: Pepper LaBeija, a legendary ""mother"" of the House of LaBeija; Dorian Corey, an aging queen who dispenses wisdom; Venus Xtravaganza, a young trans woman dreaming of becoming a ""spoiled, rich white girl."" The ""houses"" function as chosen families for young people rejected by their biological relatives, led by mothers who mentor and protect their children. The documentary explores how ball culture provided space for creativity and dignity amid poverty, racism, homophobia, and the AIDS crisis. Venus's murder during filming adds devastating weight to the film's examination of the dangers facing trans women. The documentary introduced mainstream audiences to terms like ""shade,"" ""reading,"" and ""voguing"" that would later enter popular culture."
The Rocky Horror Picture Show,1975,"Brad and Janet, a newly engaged couple, get a flat tire on a rainy night and seek help at a nearby castle. There they encounter Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-described ""sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania,"" who is about to unveil his creation: Rocky Horror, a muscular blonde man built for pleasure. What follows is a night of seduction, jealousy, murder, floor shows, and alien revelations. Brad and Janet's innocent worldview is shattered as Frank-N-Furter introduces them to sexual liberation. The film was a flop on initial release but found eternal life as a midnight movie phenomenon. Audiences dress as characters, shout callbacks at the screen, throw toast and rice, and perform the ""Time Warp"" dance in aisles. Its celebration of sexual fluidity and gender nonconformity made it a queer touchstone long before such representation was mainstream. The film's campy embrace of pleasure without shame—""Don't dream it, be it""—resonated with audiences who felt like freaks themselves."
Pride,2014,"In 1984, during Margaret Thatchers government, the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike. Mark Ashton, a gay activist in London, saw a connection between the oppression of miners and the oppression of queer people—both groups demonized by the Thatcher administration and brutalized by police. He organized Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, collecting donations in buckets at Pride marches. Most mining communities rejected their help, but the small Welsh village of Onllwyn accepted. The film follows the unlikely alliance that develops as the LGSM activists travel to Wales, initially meeting suspicion and homophobia but gradually building genuine friendship with the mining community. The villages women, particularly Hefinas character, become crucial bridges between the groups. The alliance had real historical consequences: when the strike ended, mining unions supported Labour Party proposals for LGBTQ+ rights, contributing to eventual legal protections. The film balances humor with the serious political stakes of both movements, depicting a time when solidarity across difference changed history. Based on true events, the film celebrates how marginalized communities can find common cause while honestly depicting the prejudice that had to be overcome."
