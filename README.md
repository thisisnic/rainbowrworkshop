# LLMs in R for Data Analysis

## rainbowR 2026 Conference Workshop by Nic Crane

### Workshop Overview

LLMs can be massively useful in R workflows, when used in the right places and if you're aware of not only the benefits, but also the risks. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to use LLMs programmatically in R, and come away with both the confidence to experiment and a working script that extracts data from unstructured text.

We'll look at where LLMs can help, where they'll let you down, and techniques for making your results more trustworthy. You're going to leave with a practical sense of what's possible and where to be cautious.

**What you'll learn:**

- Getting started with LLMs in R using {ellmer}
- Prompt engineering for more predictable results
- Extracting structured data from unstructured text
- Using LLMs to call R functions (tool calling)
